#### Optional support for alerts on iOS

> :warning: We use [method swizzling](https://medium.com/rocknnull/ios-to-swizzle-or-not-to-swizzle-f8b0ed4a1ce6) to enable support for alerts on iOS. Method swizzling is used by [Firebase iOS SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client#method_swizzling_in) as well, but it can be problematic in some cases, especially when another library is also swizzling the same method. Thatâ€™s why we have made this step optional.

To enable support for alerts on iOS, please follow the steps below:

1. Open your `/ios/{projectName}/AppDelegate.m` file
1. At the top of the file, import the OverrideColorScheme module: `#import <OverrideColorScheme.h>`
1. And then, within your existing `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, add `[OverrideColorScheme fixAlerts];` to the top of the method (see below).

```Objective-C

#import <OverrideColorScheme.h> // <--- import

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  [OverrideColorScheme fixAlerts]; // <--- and add this line
  //...
}
```

### Android

No additional step is required.

## Usage

```js
import overrideColorScheme from 'react-native-override-color-scheme';

// ...

overrideColorScheme.setScheme('dark'); // or `light` or `undefined` for system default
```

See the [example](example) for advanced use cases.
